# CONFIGURATION

To install and run` movie-db-front` application you need to download and install `GIT`, and `NODE.JS`. Then open `CMD` type `git` to check if it is installed properly (you have to restart your `cmd` when you install `GIT` or `NODE.JS`) then head to folder where you want to clone your repository. 

Type `git clone https://github.com/MM9PK/movie-db-front.git` and type your credentials to existing git account. 

# IDE 

I suggest to download Visual Studio Code to work with front end project and add some extensions like HTML/CSS/JS/JSON auto formatting. I highly recommend to auto format your code with default shortcut Ctrl + Alt + F. It will help with clarity of code and change tracking in git.
