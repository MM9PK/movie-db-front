# CONFIGURATION

To install and run` movie-db-front` application you need to download and install `GIT`, and `NODE.JS`. Then open `CMD` type `git` to check if it is installed properly (you have to restart your `cmd` when you install `GIT` or `NODE.JS`) then head to folder where you want to clone your repository. 

Type `git clone https://github.com/MM9PK/movie-db-front.git` and type your credentials to existing git account. 

# IDE 

I suggest to download Visual Studio Code to work with front end project and add some extensions like `HTML/CSS/JS/JSON` auto formatting. I highly recommend to auto format your code. You can do it by pressing default shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + F`. It will help with clarifying the code and change tracking in git.

# FIRST STEPS IN PROJECT

After doing all above press `Ctrl + J` and click Terminal to run `powershell`, it's built-in `cmd`. Type `git checkout develop` This is our main branch which all other branches will be merged to. We DO NOT commit any changes on `master` branch. Then type `git fetch`, `git pull`. To create new branch type in `git checkout -b <NUMBER_FROM_TRELLO-new_branch_name>` All branches must be created based on `develop` branch which means you have to checkout develop branch before creating new one.
